<h2>My Workspace. <br>My Studio.</h2>
<p>My first “studio” was our 2-car garage. Living in the city, a 2-car garage is very literal, it fits two cars and not much else, but after employing some very clever shelving and Tetris-like strategies, I was able to cram in both of our cars, as well as my ever-growing list of tools. But working in there meant removing one or both cars, deploying my tools, setting up work areas, and then putting it all back at the end of the day to park the cars again. That workspace served me well for almost 7 years. Every time, a neighbor would walk in, they would ask, “What do you do with all these tools”. I was always proud to walk them around our house, show off the latest projects and things on our next to-do list. Although, it was very convenient (and cheap) space, I was finding that I was limited in the size and scope of my projects.</p>

<p>As I became more proficient, one-day projects turned into weekend projects and eventually morphed into month long (or more) adventures. This wasn’t an issue during the summer, but would become frustrating during snowstorms when we really needed to park inside or when I would have to periodically stop and clean all the wood/metal dust off everything else we stored in the garage.</p><p>Once I became a little more established, I took more time to work on my passion, so I expanded by obtaining a flex warehouse space where I could set up a larger area to create some bigger pieces and begin building up an inventory. Monkey in the Metal now had a permanent home.</p>

<h4>MY TOOL MANTRA</h4>
<p>I am an advocate for buying vintage American made tools. They are the best (in my opinion) when it comes to the large pieces of industrial equipment that get the job done well. Some of the items I buy will be heirloom items that I can pass down to my grandkids when the time comes. Most of the things I try to buy are older than me (and sometimes my parents). There’s just something about a vise made in 1942 that can’t be duplicated in today’s world at a price that is obtainable. I spend time every day (and I really mean everyday-even vacations) scouring the Internet for vintage American made tools. If you want to build something great, I’ve find out the hard way, you need to invest in tools that let you create to the best of your ability.</p>

<h4>Buyig a Welder <span></span></h4>
<div class="article">I bought this saw years ago, one of my first tool purchases.
